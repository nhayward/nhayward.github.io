				<h3><b>The Challenge:</b> how to handle the online RSVP</h3>
				<p>I wanted a more fun and interesting interaction than just filling out a single text box with information. I also wanted to make sure that all of the required information was received so that guests didn't need to be chased down for additional details. Also on the wishlist was the ability to present an invitation and RSVP form that was tailored to the current guest who was RSVP'ing.</p>
				<p>The decision was to provide individualized codes that a guest would enter into a box which would then generate their tailored invitation and RSVP form. My original plan was to have two JSON arrays: one for all the guest specific invitations/codes and one to store their RSVP responses. I quickly realized that the code for that would become messy since I would need to write to the file in order to update the guest RSVP array to store form responses.</p>
				<p>I ultimately decided to explore the use of a Google Spreadsheet as a sort of database. I filled out a spreadsheet with guest codes, names, and the number in their party. This was all the info I needed to customize their invitations and forms. I also created another tab in that same workbook that was initially empty save for the column headers. Upon submit of a code I make an ajax call to the first tab of the sheet to check that the code entered is a valid code. I then pull the remainder of the info from the matched spreadsheet row and insert it where needed to show the invitation and RSVP form. Upon submission of the RSVP form I make an ajax call to the second tab of the sheet to store the responses. This all allows for easy management of guest data and responses in a user friendly environment.</p>
				<p><i>If you would like to test the RSVP interaction, click the live site link below or click the image in this panel. Then navigate to the "Invitation" section and use one of the following codes: testcode1, testcode2, testcode3, testcode4, or testcode5.</i></p>

				<h3><b>The Challenge:</b> how to handle the blog</h3>
				<p>I didn't want to have to build a full blog application from scratch, but I also didn't want to be constrained by themes of existing blog applications that would clash with the site as a whole. In addition, the client wanted an easy way to post to the blog without having to manually add content to the source code itself.</p>
				<p>I initially tried inserting a few out-of-the-box blog tools that would theoretically integrate smoothly without affecting the existing UI, but lack of necessary technologies on the hosting platform as well as poor documentation of the tools themselves caused me to abandon most of them. I eventually decided to dive into WordPress. I hadn't considered WordPress at first because I saw it as a larger application base that would be used for building a site from start to finish, and I honestly wanted more control than that over the source code.</p>
				<p>What I eventually discovered was that I could download the wordpress source code, move it into a section of my site, and utilize it's functionality within my already existing code. I created the blog in WordPress pointing to the specific area of the site that was going to use the blog. In that way the remainder of the site has nothing to do with it, and as far as WordPress is concerned the rest of the site doesn't even exist. In that way I was able to build a blog that was usable by the client through WordPress, but used my own styling and layout.</p>

				<h3><b>The Challenge:</b> how to re-imagine the layout of the website without straying too far from the original design</h3>
				<p>The client wanted the exact same site reproduced. In addition, the client was experiencing issues with cost of maintenance of the existing site and wanted a more cost efficient option. The issue of cost was not a huge challenge. They were using a marketing company that was charging them a large monthly fee for site maintenance, when the actual content updating and brand promotion was actually being done by the client. I was able to convince them to drop that marketing company and host their site elsewhere with a much lower monthly cost.</p>
				<p>As I mentioned, the real challenge came with cleaning up the existing site without changing it too much. I ended up starting completely from scratch. It was easier than attempting to obtain the source code from the marketing company which, once obtained, was actually a huge mess. The main issue was their navigation. There were five navigation links at the top of the page to link to their various services. Not a problem normally, but the names of those navigation links, and consequently the content of the pages they linked to, had a disjointed structure. The fifth link for example was titled "FAQ / Services / Contact".</p>
				<p>I ended up reducing the site down to three pages: "Home", "Services", "Contact Us". Within those pages I added an additional subnavigation interaction using jQuery UI tabs. In this way I was able to present a larger amount of information on a page while still keeping it contained to it's own shell. This cleaned up the navigation while still allowing for all the information that the client wanted to convey to be presented separately. They were ultimately happy with the solution.</p>
